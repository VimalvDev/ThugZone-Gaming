            <p>At Thug Zone, we want to make sure everyone has a great experience with our championships. Here's a
                straightforward guide on how our refund process works:</p>

            <h2>Cancelling Your Registration:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quick Cancellations:</strong> If you need to cancel your registration, try to do it right
                    away. If you cancel right after signing up, you might get a full refund.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Cancellable Events:</strong> Some events can't be canceled due to specific rules. Make
                    sure to check the event details before you sign up.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Getting a Refund:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>If We Cancel:</strong> If we have to cancel an event, you'll get your registration fee back
                    in full.</li>
                <li><strong>If You Withdraw:</strong> If you decide to back out of a championship, let us know at least
                    3 days before the event starts. If you do, you can get a refund. If it's too close to the event, we
                    might not be able to refund you.</li>
                <li><strong>Emergencies:</strong> If something unexpected happens, get in touch with our Customer
                    Service team. We'll look at these cases individually.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Who Can Get a Refund:</h2>
            <p>Refunds are available if we cancel an event or if you withdraw at least 3 days before it starts.</p>
            <p>Make sure to request your refund at least 3 days before the event.</p>
        </section>

        <section>

                <li>We'll review your request and process the refund if it qualifies.</li>
            </ul>
