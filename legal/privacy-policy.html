            <p>Our services are made for persons/users aged 13 and above. We do not knowingly gather personal
                information from
                children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and discover your child has shared personal data with
                us,
                please contact us immediately. Should we find that we have inadvertently collected data from a child
                under 13
                without parental consent, we will promptly take steps to erase that data from our records.</p>
